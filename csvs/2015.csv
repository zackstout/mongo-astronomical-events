"January 3, 4",Quadrantids Meteor Shower. ,"The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak.

It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th.  Unfortunately the nearly full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky."

April 4,Total Lunar Eclipse.," A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes completely through the Earth's dark shadow, or umbra. During this type of eclipse, the Moon will gradually get darker and then take on a rusty or blood red color. The eclipse will be visible throughout most of North America, South America, eastern Asia, and Australia. ("

It peaks this year on the night  22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce bright dust trails that last for several seconds.  The first quarter moon will set shortly after midnight, leaving fairly dark skies for the what could be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Lyra, but can appear anywhere in the sky."

# Astronomical Events
Using Mongo to store and then make queries on some info I've [scraped](http://www.seasky.org/astronomy/astronomy-calendar-current.html) about astronomical phenomena.

## Getting started:
You'll need to `clone` or download this repo and then uncomment the `generateDB()` function call in `server.js`. This generates the database; you need only run it once.

## Built with:
- Mongo, Mongoose
- Fast-csv
- jQuery
- Node
